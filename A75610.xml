            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

My Lord I can teſtifie againſt him, that he impoſed great Taxes upon us, and if we did not pay him as ſoon as ever he demanded them, he either quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Souldiers upon us, or elſe fetcht away by violence from us, ten times the worth of the Tax he required: he alſo hindred the trading amongſt us, kept us bare of mony, and made us pay Exciſe for Meat and drink, and layed inſupportable Taxes upon us, yea we gave him the meat out of our mouths.</p>
            <p>And my Lord, he even out of meer ſpite, ſtole away the Gates and Chains of the City, and made Bonſiers of the Poſts.</p>
            <p>And whereas his name was called <hi>the Good old Cauſe</hi> before, it was afterwards called the <hi>Rump.</hi> I think my Lord, becauſe he would not be known, for he did hide himſelf ſomtimes, being aſhamed of his doings, and then again would wipe his mouth and come to light. Mr.
<hi>Country-man</hi> that is here my Lord can give evidence alſo againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:119366:6"/>
               <hi>Judge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Country-man,</hi> what can you ſay to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner at the Bar?</p>
            <p>My Lord, this Fellow did ſend Troops of Horſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Houſes, and Inns, which eat up all our Hay, Oats, Beans, and Peas, yea my Lord he ſuffered his Horſes to go into the Medows, and Corn Fields, to eat it, tread it down and ſpoil it, and when we complained againſt him for ſuch abuſes, he would do ten times worſe; take the bread and meat out of our mouths, eat up our Bacon, kill our Poultry, and Geeſe, and Ducks, and Lambs, and Hogs, inſomuch that we had not any thing left for to keep us alive, and kept us out of our beds, that we never had a good nights reſt; and if we refuſed, preſently he would ſet a Piſtol or Sword againſt our breſts, and force us to give what they required: Mr. <hi>King</hi> can ſay much more againſt him then I have ſpoken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judge,</hi> Mr. <hi>King,</hi> what can you ſay againſt the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the Bar? My Lord, I can ſay thus much of him, that he is as great an adverſary to any of my name, as can be, yea he is a mortal enemy, for he hates their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, place, name, and perſon, he covets their Houſes, Mannors, Lands, Jewels, Plate, Apparrel, and what not? He endeavours to make them but titular or none, he will break the oath of Allegiance, he will promiſe to make them glorious, and yet fight againſt them, keeps no fidelity, ſends out Armies, as if it were to bring him home from Councellours, but with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to kill him, yet diſparageth him of breach of truſt, intrudes into his Militia, takes away his revenews, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viles them that adhere to him, gave out Commiſſions to Rebel, and to ſecure all orthodox Miniſters, and put out of their Benefices, and to bring in Anabaptiſm, Independantiſm, Quakeriſm, Ranteriſm, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of prophaneneſſe, and Poperiſm, and all things to<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119366:6"/>confuſion. Nay my Lord, I can ſay of this Fellow, the <hi>Good old Cauſe,</hi> that he put to death a Gentleman of my name, who was the moſt eminent and famous in the World for Prudence, Goodneſſe, Love, Chaſtity, Godly life, good Government, Piety, Religion, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and a Defender of the Faith, and baniſht his dear Wife and Children, and would not ſuffer them to injoy the ſmalleſt Cottage he had, or allow him the leaſt maintenance that might be; yea, forbid ſtrangers in other Lands to ſupply him in his neceſſity, and to relieve his wants: My Lord, he is the greateſt Rebel that ever was heard of, all which he did under the Title of doing Reformation: Yea my Lord, he made Plots himſelf, and then diſcovered them, and we ſuffer'd for it.</p>
            <p>My Lord, we can bring many witneſſes more of this ill life and name, if it pleaſe your Lordſhip to call for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judge,</hi> Here are witneſſes enough: Jury, have you heard what theſe Gentlemen have evidenced againſt the Priſoner at the Bar? if you have, give it in, if you be agreed of the Verdict; what think you of him, is he guilty or not guilty?</p>
            <p>The foreman Mr. <hi>Conſcience,</hi> anſwers in the behalf of the reſt, guilty my Lord.</p>
            <p>Then the Judge ſpeaking to the Priſoner, ſaid, <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> thou haſt heard what all theſe have witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt thee; what canſt thou ſay for thy ſelf, why Sentence of Death ſhould not be pronounced againſt thee? then the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> ſpake as followeth.</p>
            <p>Good my Lord, I am accuſed wrongfully, I am not the <hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi> that they took me to be for; My Lord, it ſtands upon me now to ſpeak for my life, I beſeech you my Lord here me a little.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judge,</hi> What haſt thou to ſay? My Lord, only
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119366:7"/>two or three words, which is this: I was ſummoned

My Lord, I put down all Organs in the Churches, and break in pieces all the Windows painted with the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, or any other Image or Saint in them; I plucked down all Croſſes that were on Church Steeples, and in Market places, eſpecially that great Idol the Croſſe in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> which caus'd many to bow to it: I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the word Saint to be blotted out of the Weekly Bill of Mortality, neither would I have any one to name or call a Street, or Church, by the name of St. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> Lane, or St.
<hi>Lawrence</hi> Church, or St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Lane, or St.
<hi>Bartholomew</hi> Church, or St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> or St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> or St. <hi>Peter;</hi> but <hi>Laurence</hi> Church, <hi>Laurence</hi> Lane,
<hi>Bartholomew</hi> Church, or <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Lane, or <hi>Thomas</hi> Church, or <hi>Iohns</hi> Church, or <hi>Peters,</hi> and the like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſuperſtition and popery my Lord; and I ordained Faſting days, becauſe of Prophaneneſſe and Hypocriſie; and I ordered feaſting dayes of joy, for the good things I did, and for Victories, and would not ſuffer that <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> day ſhould be kept, no nor <hi>Eaſter,</hi> or
<hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> nor any other Holy-day beſide. And my Lord, I gave commandment that no Milk ſhould be ſould between nine of the Clock in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons and four in the Afternoons, on Sundays, and that none ſhould bake any Puddings abroad on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, or ſet on their pots, or ſend for Beer or Wine out of Dores, or walk and travel abroad; and I gave the guifted people both Men and Women, to exerciſe their guifts in Conventickles, and places where they would; and I gave a toleration in Religion to weak and tender Conſciences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:119366:7"/>And for theſe things, and many more my Lord, they called me Roundhead, yet that did not at all grieve me, for I had a juſt and lawful warr: Yea my Lord, I put the Land into a poſture of defence againſt the Enemyes of the Church, and puniſhed offenders in it, and did Juſtice upon them, and would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to live; and I made my Orders and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, make Null all Acts whatſoever had been made, by any Tyrant whatſoever heretofore, and I counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced the good, and juſtified their doings, and gave to ſome of them according to their deſervings, to ſome I gave 100 <abbr>

               </abbr> or a 1000. for their good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to ſome I gave the like Quantities and Sums of mony a year, for gratuities and favours, ſome have had 1000. a year, ſome 1500. and 2000. a year, and I thought it very well beſtowed on them, and indeed they deſerved it, for they ventured their Lives for it: My Lord, I cut down Woods, and made it Arrable Land, being moſt needful, and pluckt down old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and great Houſes, which were only Dens for Thieves.</p>
            <p>And at laſt my Lord, I pluck'd down the Gates, Poſts, and Chains, of the Enemyes City, and that they ſhould not offend us any more, becauſe they were a hindrance to the intended work of Reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judge,</hi> I have heard thee a long time with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but before I pronounce Sentence againſt thee, I remember I heard in the Inditement againſt thee, that thou waſt Indited by another name beſide the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> and that was the <hi>Rump,</hi> what is the reaſon that thou haſt changed thy name?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi> anſwers, My Lord, 'tis true my Lord, I was called the <hi>Rump</hi> at the latter end; but my Lord, when I began the work of Reformation firſt, I began it in <hi>Aries,</hi> which ſignifies the Horn, and it<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119366:8"/>went on as you may remember with great incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reſolution, and having made ſuch a good progreſſe in it; that it came to ſuch a ſucceſſeful concluſion, and I found ſuch ſweetneſſe in it, that in the end I was called the
<hi>Rump:</hi> My Lord, I did not change my name becauſe I would run away, as
'twas reported; for although I was abſent ſix years, yet I ſhewed my Face again with chearfulneſſe and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and when I was put to the worſe a ſecond and third t me, I was not aſhamed of my ſelf, or my name, but I acted vigorouſly to the life in defiance of all the mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cious Adverſaries; and therefore becauſe my laſt Actions were the beſt, I thought that name moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to me, and every one was ſo taken with the name <hi>Rump,</hi> that they rejoyced exceedingly over it, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d clean caſheered my former name the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> and baptized me by the name of
<hi>Rump,</hi> in Fire, Water, and Salt. This is the very truth my Lord, that I have told, but for thoſe evidences that have witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt me that I did ſuch things, My Lord, I did do it to ſet forward the work of Reformation, and I did very good ſervice to my Country, that <hi>I</hi> acted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, and upon good grounds, therefore good my Lord be good unto me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judge, Good Old Cauſe,</hi> alias <hi>Rump,</hi> the Evidences againſt thee are clear and manifeſt, and theſe excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are vain, for thou haſt not performed the truſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee in charge, and unto which thou haſt ſworn to be true and faithful; therefore hear thy Sentence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> alias <hi>Rump,</hi> ſpeaks; Good my Lord before you give Sentence againſt me, let me ſpeak one word, it is this; during this ſitting my Lord, <hi>I</hi> acted with the moſt, and with the ſtrongeſt party; for when <hi>I</hi> ſaw which party got the upper hand, <hi>I</hi> thought it ſafe to keep my ſelf to that: whether it was in voting,<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119366:8"/>or by hands: My Lord, <hi>I</hi> cryed out for Juſtice upon de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>linquents, and made them come to compoſition <hi>I</hi> forc'd the Cavaleer party 20 Miles off the City when occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerved: My Lord I carried as fair an outſide as ever did any in the world, that none could eſpie it.</p>
            <p>Therefore good my Lord be good to me, and let me have a Pſalm of mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judge</hi> ſays, The Law affords not the benefit of the Clergie to ſuch as thou art, therefore whereas thou haſt been indited by the name of the <hi>Good old Cauſe, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Rump,</hi> and haſt been found guilty of all the blood ſpilt ſince 1640. broak thy oaths of Allegiance, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and maintained Rebellion; given out falſe Commiſſions, framed an unnatural War, kill'd thy fellow Subjects, ſpoken evil of Authority, art a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, and for theſe and all other thy forenamed Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, haſt been arraigned, and haſt pleaded not guilty; and being put upon the tryal was found guilty, and haſt no more to ſay for thy ſelf. This is the Law, thou ſhalt be carried back to the place of Execution, where thou ſhalt be hanged up by the heels, with thy <hi>Rump</hi> upward, fleed, and ſalted, and thy Head downward, thy Members, and Bowels, cut out, and thrown into the fire, thy Limbs cut off, and hung upon the Gates of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and laſtly thy Head ſhall be cut off and ſet upon a pole, and thou ſhalt be carried back to the place of Execution upon a Sledge, where thou ſhalt be hanged up by the heels, with thy Rump upward, fleed, and ſalted, then cut off, and thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, thy Members alſo ſhall be cut off, and burnt with thy Bowels.</p>
            <p>Thy Limbs alſo ſhall be cut off one by one, and hanged upon a pole at every Gate; and laſtly as thou hangeſt, thy head ſhall be cut off, &amp; ſet upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
